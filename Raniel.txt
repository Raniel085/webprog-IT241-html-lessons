Raniel Poem

In quiet days and busy nights,
I chase my dreams through fading lights.
The world feels heavy, but still I try,
To lift my hopes and let them fly.
Each step is small, yet still I grow,
With strength I never used to know.
And though the road is far from clear,
I walk with courage, not with fear.
but sometimes i scared
but i slowly walking at night
